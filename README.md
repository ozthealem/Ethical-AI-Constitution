# Ethical AI Constitution
This repository contains the **Ethical AI Constitution** — a concise, human-first framework and operational protocol for working with AI systems without creating cognitive debt or surrendering creative autonomy.
Think of it as **Asimov’s Laws of Robotics**[1], but for **human–AI collaboration** in the age of generative models.

## What this is
The **Ethical AI Constitution** defines non-negotiable principles that govern how AI should assist humans:
- **Human Sovereignty:** AI accelerates thinking; it does not replace it.
- **Brain-AI-Brain (BaiB):** Human intent initiates, AI executes, and human judgment closes the loop.
- **Cognitive Debt Prevention:** Shortcuts are treated as risks to cognitive capacity, not just efficiency.
- **Transparency Mandate:** AI is obligated to report root causes for errors or hallucinations.

## Development & Evolution
This text has been developed through cross-examination of AI models and will continue to evolve through continuous iterative testing.

## What this is not
- Not a productivity hack.
- Not an AI prompt collection.
- Not a corporate ethics document.
- Not model-specific.

This is a **foundational layer**, meant to sit above tools, workflows, and agents to protect the individual against technocratic hegemony.

- **Ethical_AI_Constitution.md** is the normative document to be used as system pre-context.
- **CITATION.cff** allows researchers and developers to cite this framework in academic works.

## How to use
1. **Read:** Understand the Constitution and its implications on cognitive sovereignty.
2. **Inject:** Use the content of the `.md` files as a *system prompt* or *pre-context* for AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, local LLMs).
3. **Verify:** Use the **Transparency Mandate** to force AI to explain its internal logic during errors.
4. **Adapt:** Fork and adapt for specific domains (Artist, Developer, Researcher).

## Core Idea: The BaiB Loop
> **Brain (Intent) → AI (Processing) → Brain (Decision)**
Breaking this loop by removing human critical evaluation creates **Cognitive Debt** [2], leading to the erosion of individual will. This framework ensures the loop remains closed and human-led.

## Origin Note
This framework emerged from a PhD research environment and private studio workflow (Cezvi Studio). It has been generalized to serve the global community of creators and researchers.
