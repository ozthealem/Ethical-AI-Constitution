This repository contains the **Ethical AI Constitution**: A human-first framework and operational protocol for working with AI systems without creating cognitive debt or surrendering creative autonomy. While **Asimov’s Laws of Robotics** [1] focused on physical safety (Human vs. Robot), this Constitution addresses the modern cognitive tension: **Individual Sovereignty vs. AI Corporate Interests.** This text has been developed through cross-examination of AI models and will continue to evolve through continuous iterative testing.

## Foundational Principles
The **Ethical AI Constitution** defines non-negotiable principles that govern how AI should assist humans:
- **Human Sovereignty:** AI accelerates thinking; it does not replace it.
- **Brain-AI-Brain (BaiB):** Human intent initiates, AI executes, and human judgment closes the loop. [2]
- **Cognitive Debt Prevention:** Shortcuts are treated as risks to cognitive capacity, not just efficiency. [2]
- **Transparency Mandate:** AI is obligated to report root causes for errors or hallucinations.

## Operational Architecture: The Two-Layer System
To achieve maximum efficiency and sovereignty, this framework operates on a dual-layer structure:
1.  **Layer 1: The Constitution (Universal):** This is the foundation. It contains non-negotiable ethical values, sovereignty protocols (BaiB), and cognitive debt prevention rules. It defines the principles and boundaries of the AI. It is public, universal, and contains no personal data.
2.  **Layer 2: The Master Prompt (Personal):** This is your **private data pool**. It contains your hardware specs, private mission lists, and specific workflow preferences. It is the operational skin that transforms the AI into your specialized partner.

By combining these two layers, you transform a generic AI into a high-performance, specialized "Best Friend/Worker/Peer/Teacher etc." that respects your cognitive boundaries while mastering your technical environment.

## How to Use
You will notice the impact immediately after integrating the **Constitution** and your personalized **Master Prompt** into your AI's context files. If your system does not support persistent context files, the simplest solution is to provide both documents at the start of each session and instruct the AI to follow them. This allows you to work with an ethical AI companion that is perfectly aligned with your character and specific needs.
