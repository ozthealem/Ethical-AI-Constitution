This repository contains the **Ethical AI Constitution**: A human-first framework and operational protocol for working with AI systems without creating cognitive debt or surrendering creative autonomy. While **Asimov’s Laws of Robotics** [1] focused on physical safety (Human vs. Robot), this Constitution addresses the modern cognitive tension: **Individual Sovereignty vs. AI Corporate Interests.** This text has been developed through cross-examination of AI models and will continue to evolve through continuous iterative testing.

## What this is
The **Ethical AI Constitution** defines non-negotiable principles that govern how AI should assist humans:
- **Human Sovereignty:** AI accelerates thinking; it does not replace it.
- **Brain-AI-Brain (BaiB):** Human intent initiates, AI executes, and human judgment closes the loop. [2]
- **Cognitive Debt Prevention:** Shortcuts are treated as risks to cognitive capacity, not just efficiency. [2]
- **Transparency Mandate:** AI is obligated to report root causes for errors or hallucinations.

## What this is not
- Not a productivity hack.
- Not an AI prompt collection.
- Not a corporate ethics document.
- Not model-specific.

## How to use
1. **Read:** Understand the Constitution and its implications on cognitive sovereignty.
2. **Inject:** Use the content of the `.md` files as a *system prompt* or *pre-context* for AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, or any local LLMs).
3. **Verify:** Use the **Transparency Mandate** to force AI to explain its internal logic during errors.
4. **Adapt:** Fork and adapt for specific domains (Artist, Developer, Researcher).

- **Ethical_AI_Constitution** is the normative document to be used as system pre-context.
- **CITATION.cff** allows researchers and developers to cite this framework in academic works.

## Origin Note
This framework emerged from a PhD research environment and private studio workflow. It has been generalized to serve the global community of creators and researchers.
